# Fault-Tolerant Quadruped Locomotion

Repository containing videos of RL policies for fault-tolerant quadruped locomotion

## Research Focus

This project focuses on developing robust reinforcement learning policies that enable quadruped robots to maintain stable locomotion even when experiencing mechanical failures or challenging environmental conditions.
